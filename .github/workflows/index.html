        <!--Introduction-->
        <p>I initially didn't care to watch Gravity Falls. I had seen a few commercials for it and, shamefully, thought
          to myself <q>why would I watch a dumb kids show?</q> Which, looking back on it, seems a bit strange
          considering I love Adventure Time. But in any case, as soon as I had decided not to watch it, I was suddenly
          surrounded by it. Wherever I went on the internet, I would see a gif or a passing comment or
          <em>something</em> tangentially related to this show. And the next thing I knew, I had binged all of season
          one within a week.</p>
        <p>What is Gravity Falls, you ask? It's a cartoon created by <a
            href="https://twitter.com/_alexhirsch?lang=en">Alex Hirsch</a> about 12-year old twins Dipper and Mabel
          Pines who travel to Gravity Falls, Oregon to spend time with their Great Uncle, or <q>Grunkle</q> Stan, for
          the
          summer. We get to meet the citizens of the town over the course of the show and, of course, hijinks ensue. And
          who doesn't love hijinks?</p>
        <p>Allow me to take a moment to explain why you should watch one of my favourite shows.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <!--Plot-->
        <h2>The Plot</h2>
        <p>Here's a spoiler-free introduction to the plot: Dipper finds a mysterious journal in the woods written by an
          unknown author who writes that Gravity Falls is a weird town full of mysteries. Dipper
          becomes determined to find <q>The Author</q> and solve some mysteries of his own, but the The Author has
          written to trust no one.</p>
        <p>The Gravity Falls fandom has developed a collective reputation of being super sleuths. The foreshadowing in
          this show is intense, and there are major plot clues hidden in plain sight. When the show was airing, fans
          were always discussing theories and possible plot lines. And when thousands of theorists come together, some
          ideas are bound to be right.</p>
        <article> <!--One issue said to remove this article tag but I want to keep it in since it's a separate contained subsection of 'Plot'-->
          <h3>Cryptograms and Ciphers</h3>
          <figure>
            <img src="img/cipher-wheel.png" alt="Gravity Falls cipher wheel">
            <figcaption>Cipher wheel from the show's opening sequence.</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>Perhaps one of the most intriguing aspects of the show is the use of cryptograms and ciphers. That
            backwards and non-sensical text you see for one second on screen? Yeah, that might be a plot point. A
            character says something that sounds like complete gibberish? They're probably saying it backwards and it's
            entirely possible that it's crucial information. On the other hand, part of GF's charm is that it's fun so
            these
            codes and messages might be just that - for fun.</p>

        <!--Characters-->
        <h2>The Characters</h2>
        <figure>
          <img src="img/gravity-falls-main-characters.jpg" alt="Main characters of Gravity Falls">
          <figcaption>And here's the main cast.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>I will say right now that my fave character in this show is Grunkle Stan <del><a
              href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbfDpQ7vmfs">spoilers kinda not really</a></del>. I can't really
          choose between the
          twins<sub>and why would you want to?</sub></p>
        <p>What's great about these characters is that they're not perfect. They have flaws and they make mistakes, but
          the important thing is that they learn from their mistakes. It's satisfying to watch these characters grow
          over the course of two seasons.</p>
        <p>And I suppose part of the reason why fans love the characters is because their interactions are grounded in
          reality. Here's an excerpt from the creator on the stories and relationships in the show:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><q>There's a balance of ingredients every episode has to have. But every episode must have that element,
              and I think a lot of the most successful moments of the show are the ones where the character
              relationship, the ones that I thought I was being the most personal and being the most referencing my own
              specific life, often wound up feeling the most universal.</q></p>
          <cite>Alex Hirsch for Vox, <time>August 1<sup>st</sup>, 2014</time></cite>

      <section>
        <!--Art-->
        <h2>The Art</h2>
        <figure>
          <img src="img/gravity-falls-forest-background.jpg" alt="forest background from ending credits of an episode">
          <figcaption>This is just so calming to look at.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Not to be dramatic, but I just really <strong>love</strong> the art direction in this show. Like, mystical,
          spooky, whatever it is - you know it looks amazing. I have a bunch of stills from the show as rotating
          wallpapers on my laptop.</p>
    
          <p>I'm going to lump music under this section because, really, the music in this show is an art form. <a
              href="https://bradbreeck.com/"> Brad Breeck</a> has composed a wonderful score for this show. It can be
            fun in one moment and heart-wrenching in the next. I hear the music in this show and I just wanna... learn
            these songs on the piano, and I can barely play the piano. And who doesn't love that <a
              href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2DUpDxFJyg">iconic theme song</a>.
